# DriveSense

We present DriverSense!  An AI-powered solution aimed at helping insurance providers protect and reward safe young drivers. According to the RAC's 2024 Report on Motoring, 55% of under-25s admit to making calls while driving - more than double the general population's rate.

Our questionably engineered computer vision program actively monitors and prevents distracted driving, giving insurers concrete data to reward safer behaviour.

DriverSense runs on a simple dashboard with an inward-facing camera. It helps young (and old ðŸ˜‰) drivers build better habits while allowing insurers to reduce their risk exposure in this high-risk demographic. As the RAC reports distracted driving among young drivers reaching an eight-year high, our DriverSense offers insurers a data-driven way to incentivize safer driving.
